= Firmata Library for Arduino =

The Firmata library implements the Firmata protocol for communicating with software on the host computer. This allows you to write custom firmware without having to create your own protocol and objects for the programming environment that you are using.

The Firmata source code is hosted outside of the Arduino code repository. Please visit the Firmata
GitHub repository at https://github.com/firmata/arduino to file issues, make contributions or obtain the latest version of the library.

To learn more about the Firmata protocol, see the protocol documentation site at https://github.com/firmata/protocol.

Slightly outdated documentation is also available at http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Firmata.
